Agent A – App UI (WinUI 3, .NET 8)

Goal (M1):
Create a Dataset Studio page that visualizes:
- waveform of the selected clip
- segment overlays from manifest.json
- hover shows ASR text; if aligned.json exists show per-word timings

Scope:
- Project: /src/App (WinUI 3 solution already exists from M0; if not, create)
- New page: /src/App/Pages/DatasetStudioPage.xaml (+ .xaml.cs)
- Services: IFilePicker, IProjectService (read from %LOCALAPPDATA%/VoiceStudio/settings.json for project root)
- Data files: 
  C:\VoiceStudio\projects\demo\dataset\segments\manifest.json
  C:\VoiceStudio\projects\demo\dataset\segments\asr.json
  (optional) aligned.json

Requirements:
- A “Load Project” button that remembers last folder (SettingsService).
- A file tree (left) for project browsing; when user clicks a segment .wav, render waveform and overlays.
- Use NAudio to render waveform (precompute peaks) or draw a simple amplitude plot (fast enough for <10 min files).
- No ML or FFmpeg calls from UI; read-only.
- Include a minimal MVVM structure, commands, and an error banner area.
- Provide: file tree, code diffs, build steps, and a short test checklist.

Acceptance:
- Page compiles and navigates from Home
- Given demo project, overlays are visible; hovering a segment displays its ASR text
- If aligned.json exists and contains `words`, draw inner word markers.

Commands:
- dotnet add package NAudio --version 2.2.1
- dotnet build / run
