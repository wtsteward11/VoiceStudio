Agent C – PluginHost Safe Mode & Validation

Goal (M1):
- Add a Safe Mode switch: when ON, third-party plugins are not loaded (only first-party IDs allowed).
- Strengthen manifest validation (schema + signature). Unknown capabilities cause a clear logged warning and plugin skip.

Scope:
- Project: /src/PluginHost
- Add: SafeMode boolean sourced from %LOCALAPPDATA%/VoiceStudio/settings.json
- Update: manifest parser to validate fields; signature file optional for dev.
- Provide: unit tests for safe mode, invalid manifest, unknown capability

Acceptance:
- With SafeMode=true, a third-party plugin folder is ignored with a log line.
- Invalid manifest doesn’t crash the app; clear message is shown.
