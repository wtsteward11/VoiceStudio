Agent D â€“ Workers: Segment Quality (SNR) + flags

Goal (M1):
- Compute per-segment SNR (simple RMS-based) and store `snr_db` on each segment in manifest.json
- Add `--snr` flag to vad.py to enable calculation during VAD; or provide standalone snr_report.py operating on segments dir.

Reference SNR (simple):
snr_db = 20 * log10( (rms(signal)) / (rms(noise_estimate)+1e-9) )
For a fast heuristic, estimate noise as RMS of lowest 10% frames.

Scope:
- Files: /workers/python/vsdml/vad.py (optionally) and /workers/python/vsdml/snr_report.py
- Output: write back manifest.json with new field `snr_db` per segment

Provide:
- Python code
- requirements delta if any (uses numpy + soundfile which already exist)
- run commands
- sample output

Acceptance:
- manifest.json shows `snr_db` floats for each segment
- smoke-m1.ps1 prints average SNR for the dataset
