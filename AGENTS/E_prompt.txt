Agent E â€“ CI/Build

Goal (M1):
- Extend .github/workflows/ci.yml to:
  a) build Core and Client
  b) set up Python venv for workers
  c) run smoke-m0.ps1 and then smoke-m1.ps1 (allow skipping align if model unavailable)
  d) retain artifacts for 7 days

Scope:
- File: .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Cache: pip cache by requirements hash
- Upload: logs, outputs under C:\VoiceStudio\projects\demo
- Actions may be OFF in GPT; still provide workflow YAML that runs locally or when turned on.

Acceptance:
- On a repo with this layout, CI passes smoke scripts (or marks align optional) and uploads artifacts.
