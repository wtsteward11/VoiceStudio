# VoiceStudio – MASTER PLAN
M0: Tools up (FFmpeg, Piper), Core↔Client TTS ✅
M1 (current): Full dataset pipeline (Convert→VAD→ASR→Align), TTS, VC stub, gRPC job shapes, smoke tests
M2: Wire Agents (B orchestration, D worker), retries, logs, metrics
M3: Replace VC stub with proper VC model; improve UI/CLI
